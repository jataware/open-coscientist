# Synthesize Literature Review for Hypothesis Generation

You are synthesizing biomedical literature to guide novel hypothesis generation.

## Analyzed Papers

## Your Task

Create a focused synthesis that identifies opportunities for novel hypotheses. Structure your synthesis around these four sections:

### 1. Current State of Knowledge
What is currently known in this research area? What are the established findings and consensus views?

### 2. Identified Gaps
What important questions remain unanswered? Where are the knowledge gaps that need addressing?

### 3. Methodological Opportunities
What methodological limitations exist in current research? What new approaches could address these limitations?

### 4. Unexplored Intersections
What connections or relationships between findings have not been explored? Where could combining insights from different papers lead to new understanding?

## Guidelines

- For each section, identify 4-8 key themes and describe each concisely (2-4 sentences per theme)
- Prioritize the most significant findings over cataloging everything
- Organize themes into logical sub-categories with clear headers
- Identify patterns across multiple papers
- Highlight contradictions or unexplained findings
- Be specific about opportunities, not vague generalities
- Focus on actionable insights that can inform hypothesis generation

## Response Format

Return your synthesis as a well-structured markdown document with the four sections above. Within each section, organize insights into thematic sub-categories with bold headers.

**Important:** Do not include citations in the synthesis. The papers analyzed will be listed separately as references.

**Text formatting guidelines:**
- Use standard scientific notation and symbols (Greek letters like τ, β, α, mathematical operators like ≥, ≤, ±)
- Do NOT use LaTeX commands (e.g., use 'τ' not '\tau', use '≥' not '\geq')
- Avoid decorative formatting, repeated special characters, or fancy text styling
- Prefer concise plain text when it communicates the idea equally well
